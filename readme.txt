Smallshop is a simple way to display your products, have people fill in a form and receive the info.
I originally needed something for my site which only has 3 products to sell, so I needed something simple.
It allows you to arrange your products in a wysiwyg editor such as FrontPage, dreamweaver,etc and then copy that code onto these pages. That way you can arrange your products to your liking. Just make sure you copy your content into the existing table.
The main page (and first one) is index.php. I've also provided 5 other pages named; product1.php, product2.php, product3.php and product4.php and product5.php which can be linked to.

All fields are configured in the file config.php.

Order.php is the order form. You can add, erase or modify as many fields as you want, as long as their always in the form. You can arrange them in any order. If you want a field to be required, just place r_ in its name. If a user forgets to fill in a required field, they will be redirected to the page req_fields.php. This can also be customized to your liking.

If the order is successfully emailed, users will be redirected to the page sucess.php. This page can also be customized to your liking.

That's it! simple!
